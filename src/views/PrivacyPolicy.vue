        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>
          We take precautions to protect your information.
          When you submit sensitive information via the website,
          your information is protected both online and offline.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as payment info),
          that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way.
          You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online,
          we also protect your information offline.
          The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
        </p>
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          We use "cookies" on this site.
          A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor's hard drive to help us improve your access to our site and identify repeat visitors to our site.

        <p>
